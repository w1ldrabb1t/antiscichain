\begin{abstract}
Scientific truth should be determined by the weight and structure of evidence—especially refutation (\emph{via negativa}) over time—not by popularity, reputation, or consensus. Yet modern science has increasingly become entangled with \textbf{Scientism}: a belief system that treats science as an authority to be obeyed, rather than a method to be tested.

The Antifragile Science Blockchain (ASB) is a direct response to this epistemic corruption. It builds on top of the work of Nassim Nicholas Taleb, on "Incerto' in general and "AntiFragile" in particular. 

ASB is both a protocol and a platform: the protocol defines how scientific claims are evaluated through a falsifiability-first framework, and the platform provides the open infrastructure where researchers, reviewers, and adversarial testers interact with and evolve the knowledge graph. In ASB, failed claims strengthen the system. Refutations are not buried; they are rewarded.

This paper articulates the philosophical foundations of ASB, drawing on Karl Popper's principle of falsifiability and Nassim Nicholas Taleb's concepts of \emph{antifragility} and \emph{skin in the game}. We argue that refutation (“not all swans are white”) provides far greater epistemic value than confirmation, especially in complex, non-linear systems where false confidence leads to systemic harm.

The ASB protocol implements an antifragile scientific system—one that grows stronger with every attempt to find faults, both in the system itself and in the body of knowledge it holds. By contrasting this model with the fragile, consensus-driven methods promoted by Scientism — where dissent is suppressed, negative results ignored, and incentives warped — we expose the hidden vulnerabilities in the current scientific establishment.

Through an open, censorship-resistant platform and a citation-weighting algorithm based on Evidence Fragility Score (EFS), ASB realigns science with adversarial testing, transparency of incentives, and the permanent recording of failed hypotheses. The result is not a system that fears being broken but one that welcomes it (or even needs it!).
