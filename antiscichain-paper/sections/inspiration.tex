\section{Inspiration}
Inspired by the work of Nassim Nicholas Taleb in Incerto, namely in "Antifragile". His ideas opened my mind into a new way of thinking. 

Inspired by the genius of Terry Davis and his TempleOS operating system. His passion for creating a new operating system, from scratch, alone, made me want to tackle this huge challenge myself.

To all the free thinkers of the World - may you find in this platform the space for your work to become antifragile.

This work couldn't be possible without the support of my lovely wife - Carla.

I dedicate this work to my daughter - Gabriela, my one true inspiration for life.
