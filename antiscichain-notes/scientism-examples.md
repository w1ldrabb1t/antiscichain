## The Opioid Epidemic – Purdue Pharma and the Illusion of Safety

Purdue Pharma aggressively marketed OxyContin as a safe, non-addictive painkiller, citing selectively crafted studies and physician testimonials. Internally, however, the company knew about the drug's addictive potential. It used industry-funded research, manipulated scientific claims, and influenced medical guidelines to downplay harm.

By the time the truth surfaced, the damage was massive:

- Over 500,000 deaths from opioid overdoses in the U.S. alone
- An entire generation affected by addiction
- Billions in healthcare and social costs

The cost of being wrong was catastrophic — and largely externalized. Purdue paid fines, but executives faced minimal consequences. The system had no skin in the game.

## Glyphosate and Monsanto – “No Evidence of Harm” as a Weapon

Monsanto, now part of Bayer, developed glyphosate (marketed as Roundup) and ensured its widespread use in global agriculture. For years, Monsanto-funded studies claimed there was “no evidence” that glyphosate was carcinogenic.

But this consensus was shaped by:

- Ghostwriting studies that appeared independent but were actually drafted by Monsanto
- Suppressing dissenting research
- Attacking independent scientists who raised concerns

In 2015, the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as "probably carcinogenic to humans." Thousands of lawsuits followed, and Bayer has since paid billions in settlements.

This case exemplifies how scientific absolutism, powered by capital, can become a shield for harm. Consensus was not evidence of truth — it was the product of sustained influence.

## Theranos – The Cult of Proof Without Validation

Theranos, the biotech startup founded by Elizabeth Holmes, promised revolutionary blood testing using a single drop of blood. Investors, media, and even regulatory bodies were convinced — not by open peer-reviewed research, but by carefully curated internal “proof”.

Behind the scenes:

- Devices didn’t work
- Test results were unreliable and potentially dangerous
- Employees who spoke out were silenced or retaliated against

Theranos thrived in a system where credibility was built through branding and controlled narratives, not scientific falsifiability. It wasn’t until whistleblowers and investigative journalists exposed the fraud that the collapse occurred.

Theranos shows what happens when the appearance of science is weaponized — and when those in charge face zero downside if they’re wrong.
