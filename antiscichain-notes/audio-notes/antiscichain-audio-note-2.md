# On Doing Something Or Doing Nothing

Whenever we are proposing an intervention on something, that is to say adding to an equation, specifically in a complex system, we need to evaluate two different scenarios:

## 1) the scenario of doing nothing
Even doing nothing, there is already an exposure to ruin!

We have to evaluate what is the *scale of that exposure*.
- Is it that the individual scale 
- or massive population worldwide scale?

And number two, what is *the impact of ruin*:
- is it number one almost nothing
- or is it number 10 annihilation?

So even __doing nothing already comes with a certain level of ruin exposure__, with a certain scale and impact. 

## 2) the scenario of doing something

We have to compare to the ruin exposure of doing nothing against the ruin exposure of doing something, in both scale and impact.

If the comparison between doing nothing and intervention is equal (or close), it's better to do nothing because, assuming we're talking about intervention in complex systems, we simply don't know the possible side effects that our intervention will have on the system.
Also, if a complex systems depend or inflence other systems, then this escalates to even bigger levels of complexity (think, a virus spreading across a population), making it impossible to measure (much less predict) the true full extension of the conquences of the intervention.

More, just because you don't see evidence of harm, doesn't mean that there is no harm. 
Also, just because there might be no harm right now, doesn't mean that harm might not appear tomorrow, next week, next month, next year,
five years, ten years... you just don't know. 

So because you don't know, you got to, and this is both the philosophical and ethical aspect to this, you got to be very skeptical and you got to be
very suspicious about it. Like Talab says about the Via Negativa - removing things is often better than adding things to a system that you don't understand.
