# Why Consensus Is Dangerous

Consensus can give a false sense of safety. If many people believe something is true, it becomes harder to challenge — not because it's more correct, but because it's socially reinforced. This is epistemic fragility: an idea is protected by the crowd, not by its ability to survive tests.

In antifragile learning, consensus is a signal to increase, not decrease, scrutiny — especially when:

The system involved is complex (e.g., climate models, pandemic response, genetic engineering)

The potential cost of being wrong is enormous

Those advocating for the idea have no personal downside if they’re wrong

Therefore: the more people agree something is true, the more dangerous it becomes if it isn’t — especially when the cost of error is high.
