So, I don't want to be right, I want to find the truth, I want to get to the truth, I want to learn by my mistakes.
And my mistakes actually become part of the stepping stones that will contribute to the overall scientific knowledge.
We can't make progress unless we are willing to fail.
And those that hide their mistakes and try to seem that their research and their papers and their work is perfect.
They are just not only fooling themselves but also harming others by painting this picture that they are so perfect and that their research is flawless and that their systems always work, which is not true.
Nothing always works, there are always edge cases and there's always exceptions to the rules and there are always mistakes that are made.
So, the point about improving the scientific knowledge as a whole is about exposing those mistakes, it's about exposing those errors, it's about exposing the cases where the theory doesn't quite work.
In spite all the proof in favor that the theory does work and it might work in the cases where it does work but the beauty of the scientific method is to find the cases where the theory does not indeed work.
And proving how systems don't work in some cases is in my opinion even as better if not even better than just proving that something works because all it takes is proving that a certain situation, a certain case, a certain scenario doesn't quite work for that particular theory or system to prove that the system is not 100%.
And this actually also relates to the idea or the problem of ruin because one thing is to say that I proved that the system doesn't work but what is the impact of the system not working?
Is the system not working only going to ruin me or the system not working, this particular product or system not working will actually cause the ruin of the entire human race.
Those two are really different and polar opposite scenarios.
So here I want to bring up the topic of ruin and skin in the game because if I am exposed to my own ruin and the proof in the system that I'm trying to prove that it works can only ruin me,
it's not as bad as me having no skin in the game on the particular system that I'm trying to prove that it does work but the chances of it not working actually impacts the entire human population.
Because the ruin exposure is incredibly high and I have no skin in the game meaning that I will be not harmed by this somehow.
Imagine that I have the antidote. Imagine that this is actually instead of being something that will cure all illnesses will actually be secretly hidden poison.
And I have the antidote by the way. So I am not exposed to harm or maybe I don't even have the antidote but I will not be exposed to this thing that is developed might be a drug, might be whatever.
It doesn't matter. So skin in the game matters, exposure to harm and ruin matters.
And proving that something doesn't work might be more important than proving that something does work because let's bring up the black swan example.
I can have many examples of proving that the white swan exists but all it takes is one single instance of a black swan to show and prove that not all swans are white.
And then we can extrapolate this to other areas. But the fact of the matter is that knowledge is fragile from this point of view.
So we shouldn't hold on to knowledge as this thing that is sacred and that shouldn't be challenged. No. On the other hand it's quite the opposite. It should be challenged.
It should be challenged all the time. And the more certain people are that a certain piece of knowledge is considered to be true.
The higher the chance that it's not true and doesn't matter how much evidence you have that it's true. There might be a chance that it's not true.
Another thing that must be considered here is the complexity of systems. So low complexity systems with low exposure to ruin in the arm.
The stakes are not as high compared to high complexity systems with high exposure to ruin beyond just the single person's ruin.
And then I'm talking about like big massive exposure to ruin. So I think what I'm trying to get to here is the scale.
So if the scale of ruin is high. So scale of ruin ruin matters. If the scale is high and the impact is high, then we're talking about annihilation.
So if I'm wrong, the cost of being wrong is high in those cases. If the scale of ruin is low and the ruin impact is high, meaning it might affect just one person and that one person happens to be me.
Okay, being wrong there is bad for the author, for the creator of that theory or product or system, but it doesn't escalate, doesn't go viral to the other players, to the other actors, to the other humans in the system.
Let's go. Let's take a note here. So scale scale scale of ruin. So what's the scale?
What's the impact of ruin? Is it high? Is it low? Got the traffic? Or is it like non-existent?
Non-existent? Okay, the traffic. Scale of ruin is high, meaning so many people, right? We'll affect many people or low, maybe just single people.
Not single people, you know what I mean? So scale of ruin, impact of ruin, complexity, system. What's the system complexity? What are we talking about here? Are we talking about the human biology? High complexity, yes?
High example, human biology, for example. Oh, even higher? Nature as a whole, right? You're not talking about just humans? Humans are complicated enough. Nature? Universe? Right? Oh, you shit.
Yeah, and then lower complexity, what's lower complexity systems? I don't know, calculator machine? You know what I mean? Maybe, compared to nature, calculators are dumb. So scale of ruin, impact of ruin, system complexity, all these things matter.
And what I'm trying to say is that not all papers are born equal. Not all papers are born equal, but for this first version of what I'm building, it doesn't quite matter. Because, yeah, I mean, we gotta start somewhere, we gotta start simple, we gotta start small.
But even on the smaller scale with not all the variables in the world being accounted for, they're still value in getting rid of consensus, getting rid of the exposure to hidden interests, getting rid of, you know, research, scientific research that is being
promoted by capitalist agents that have no skin in the game and benefit to gain from the research saying that A equals B. Of course, that they will prove that A equals B if they want, and if they see a way to get, you know, benefit, getting money, getting paid, getting return on their investment if A equals B.
Of course, they will show proof of A equals B. We want to open the doors to, yeah, show that it's proof that A equals B. Try, really try. And then let, let, let the world, let the world open up the platform so that the world is able to support and try to replicate.
Can we replicate that A equals B? No, we couldn't. Doesn't mean that A equals B just means A. In this situation, we couldn't replicate or even better prove that is wrong. What is wrong in that A equals B statement? What is wrong in their assumptions? What is wrong? Show and prove.
And by proving that that is wrong, it will be wrong forever. And there will be a record start forever of why it's wrong and how it's wrong. And it's proven to be wrong and then other studies, other researchers in the, in the platform in the system will either support that it's wrong because they will try to break your paper.
So by trying to break your paper, these systems will gradually and consistently improve themselves. Therefore, this system or platform is anti fragile because with ever, with every mistake that is, that is fixed with every study that is proven to be wrong.
And therefore, with every single new piece of knowledge that is found, the system as a whole gets better. The knowledge, the quality of the knowledge will improve over time.
And this is the, and this is the biggest takeaway that we can get because as soon as we, and this is something that I want to address here, as soon as we believe that knowledge is bulletproof and then, and then if we take into account the credibility of so and so of some kind of researcher company that is behind some kind of research that is done or some kind of a product that is done.
Or that was developed. It's the moment where we shut our brains off and we stop, you know, thinking critically about what's being presented to us. And ultimately, this, this is what the system does. So it's the, it's the change that we want to introduce in the scientific world in the scientific community.
And it's anti fragile by nature. And, and that's it. And that's all for now. Thank you.
