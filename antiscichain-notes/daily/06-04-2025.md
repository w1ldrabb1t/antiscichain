Epidemiological characteristics and prevalence rates of research reproducibility across disciplines: A scoping review of articles published in 2018-2019


"Most reproducibility studies were in the disciplines of psychology and health science (>72%), with 86 and 42 studies, respectively. (...) Previous research (Makel et al., 2012; Sukhtankar, 2017; Hubbard and Vetter, 1992), our findings suggest that overall only a very small fraction of research in any of these discipline published in a given year focuses on reproducing existing research published in previous papers"


"349 randomly selected research articles from the biomedical literature published in 2015-2018 (Serghiou et al., 2021) found that 33 (10%) included a reproducibility component in their research"

I am thinking about what's the incentive for scientists/researchers to do peer reviews on research papers...
I've never heard of a scientist who got a nobel prize for doing amazing peer reviews; for finding mistakes, flaws or erros in papers (and suggest ways for improving them);
So why doing peer reviews? Are they required to do so?
