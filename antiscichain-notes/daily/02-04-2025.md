Listening to the audiobook "[The Theory That Would Not Die](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007PXLU3G)" by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne.

French scientist Pierre Simon Laplace, an amateur mathematician, was the first one to come up with the idea that later inspired Bayes.

> The historical convention forces us to call the Laplace's discovery Bayes' rule.
> After the Laplace's death, researchers and academic seeking precise and objective answers pronounced his method subjective, dead, and buried.
> Yet at the very same time, practical problem solvers relied on it to deal with real-world emergencies.
> One spectacular success occurred *during the Second World War, when Alan Turing developed a base to break enigma, the German Navy's secret code, and in the process helped to both save Britain and 
> invent modern electronic computers and software*.

A thought came to my mind about ruin exposure vs war and it's influence in innovation.

When our awareness about our ruin exposure is high, it seems like our brains and minds work extra hard to find ways to avoid it, including avoiding it by bringing ruin to our enemies (i.e. the 
concept of peace by the threat of mutual destruction comes into play).
Following this train of thought, it's clear that war has been a driver for innovation in several industries but namely computer technology.

I did a quick research on this topic and found this:

## Cryptanalysis and the Birth of Modern Computing
Innovation: Colossus (1944) – The first programmable digital electronic computer.

Context: British codebreakers at Bletchley Park, led by Alan Turing and others, built Colossus to break the German Lorenz cipher.

Impact: Demonstrated the power of automation and programmable logic, inspiring later stored-program computers.

## Ballistics and Numerical Computation
Innovation: ENIAC (1945) – Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer.

Context: Designed by the U.S. Army for calculating artillery firing tables.

Impact: First general-purpose electronic computer. Influenced the development of modern computing architectures.

## Radar and Real-Time Signal Processing
Innovation: Real-time computing, analog-to-digital conversion.

Context: British and American radar development during WWII.

Impact: Led to signal processing methods foundational to modern communications, audio/video tech, and sensor data interpretation.

## Nuclear Weapons and Simulation
Innovation: Monte Carlo simulations, large-scale numeric simulations.

Context: Developed at Los Alamos to model nuclear reactions (e.g., Manhattan Project).

Impact: Core methodology in modern computing—from climate models to AI training

## Communications and Networking
Innovation: Packet switching and ARPANET (precursor to the Internet).

Context: Cold War concern over nuclear survivability of communications.

Impact: DARPA-funded research led to resilient, decentralized networking—foundational to the Internet.

## Cybernetics and Control Theory
Innovation: Feedback systems, human-machine interaction models.

Context: WWII anti-aircraft systems and guided missiles.

Impact: Led to cybernetics, influencing robotics, computer science, and cognitive science.

Ref: Wiener, N. (1948). Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine. MIT Press


## Miniaturization and Solid-State Electronics
Innovation: Transistors (1947) and integrated circuits (1950s–60s).

Context: Cold War race for lighter, faster, more durable tech (e.g., for missiles and space).

Impact: Enabled the transition from room-sized machines to personal computers and mobile tech.

## Satellite and GPS Technology
Innovation: Global Positioning System (GPS).

Context: Cold War-era navigation systems for ballistic missiles and aircraft.

Impact: Now central to navigation, mapping, mobile apps, and more.

## Surveillance and Image Processing
Innovation: Remote sensing, real-time video and pattern recognition.

Context: Reconnaissance satellites, drone technology, signal intelligence.

Impact: Advanced imaging, video compression, and early computer vision systems.

## Conclusion
I could use some of this to make my point about how ruin exposure can be used not only as a driver to avoid risks but also to innovate.
