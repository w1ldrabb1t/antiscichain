# Ruin Exposure

## Why it matters

## Scale 

## Impact

## Problems

- How to measure exposure to Ruin without relying on self-eval?


# Complexity

The complexity of a system is measured by the number of different variables that influence how the system works or behaves.

(IDEA) 
- It would be nice to include a graph where I would add more and more variables and see how that influences the chances of randomly predicting the system's output.
- Taleb shows this in Antifragile p417

## Why it matters
The complexity of the system you are experimenting with, matters. The reason why is simple. The more variables you add into a system, the harder it is to understanda how it works and predict how it will react.

## High complexity
- What Taleb calls Extremistan.
- Examples include the universe, nature or Human biology.

## Low complexity
Examples...


# Rewards

## What actions to reward
- Adding supporting papers
- Adding refuting papers (even more important!)

## Ideas
- Adding papers on a particular topic 
-- we can use this to influence the network on what kind of papers we are more interested
-- not sure if it's a good idea... the original idea is to be as agnostic as possible to what the network actors choose to do

## Problems
- The credibility score of either supporting or refutting papers change over time
-- so say you reward the owner of a paper with X eth
-- say that after some time that paper's credibility goes down by having other papers refutting them and those paper's credibility score going high (because other papers are supporting them)
-- now what do you do? do you charge the owner with Y eth? what if they don't have enough balance?
-- maybe it's not eth that we charge but our chain's currency/coin? Does that even change the problem? I mean as long as there's an account for each user, 

## How to reward
