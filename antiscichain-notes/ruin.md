# Ruin Exposure

## Why it matters

## Scale 
- Micro: cells, individuals
- Medium: families, communities
- Macro: countries, world


## Impact
- Minimal: minimum to no harm
- Catastrophic: death, extinction


## Problems

###  How to measure exposure to Ruin without relying on self-eval?
- ask the user what is the target system that the study is focusing on
- have a tuple list with the pairing between system and and the scale of ruin and impact (??)
- I think that this might be misleading at best and outright wrong most of the time...
- because it really depends on the specific details of what the research is suggesting
- maybe some research is not even suggesting anything... it might just trying to replicate or refute another paper.
- the dangerous territory is when a study focuses on "intervention"
- the key is to focus on "what is the cost of being wrong?" #errors


# Complexity

The complexity of a system is measured by the number of different variables that influence how the system works or behaves.

(IDEA)
- It would be nice to include a graph where I would add more and more variables and see how that influences the chances of randomly predicting the system>
- Taleb shows this in Antifragile p417 (!!)

## Why it matters
The complexity of the system you are experimenting with, matters. The reason why is simple. The more variables you add into a system, the harder it is to>

## Complexity Levels
- Linear: low complexity
- Non-Linear: high complexity (what Taleb calls Extremistan)
