# Testable Code and Data
One idea is to make this platform focus only on testable research
- think code unit tests
- to add a new research entry you must send the data you used and the code you used to process the data and get to the results
- this will immediately remove from the platform pure theoretical research
- what's stopping users from adding tests that just "return true"?
